 This website is a simple portfolio website made with HTML, CSS and Javascript made for my Web Programming Inidividual Project.
  In it, I show my skills, hobbies and basic information about me.
  A tools section is shown where user can go to another tools.html page or access on the current website 4 tools: a Calculator, a BMI Calculator, a Zakat Calculator and a Unit Converter.
